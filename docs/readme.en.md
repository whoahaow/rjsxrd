An automatically updated collection of public VPN configurations for bypassing blocks.

**Repository:** [github.com/whoahaow/rjsxrd](https://github.com/whoahaow/rjsxrd)  
**Telegram channel:** [t.me/rjsxrd](https://t.me/rjsxrd)

## About the project

rjsxrd collects, filters, and verifies thousands of VPN configs from open sources. The result is files ready for import into any modern VPN client.

**Key characteristics:**

- **Update:** hourly from VPS via cron (primary) + every 48 hours via GitHub Actions (fallback)
- **Protocols:** VLESS, VMess, Trojan, Shadowsocks, ShadowsocksR, Hysteria v1/v2, TUIC
- **Verification:** Xray-core or TCP ping, sorting by latency
- **Filtering:** automatic removal of insecure and non-working configs
- **SNI/CIDR:** dedicated sets for bypassing mobile whitelists
- **Telegram proxies:** collection and verification of MTProto and SOCKS5 proxies
